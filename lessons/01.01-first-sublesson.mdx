This is the first sublesson of the first part.

Here is a preview of what you might see in a sublesson.

Code samples will show up like this:

```jsx
const example = `You can embed source code in a lot of languages!`
```

## Interactive Browser Examples

One of the coolest parts is that we can use interactive browser examples like
this one.

Try changing the "reader" in `name="reader"` with your name!

```jsx live
const Greetings = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>Hey {name}!</p>
      <p>Did anyone ever tell you how awesome you are?</p>
    </>
  )
}

render(() => <Greetings name="reader" />)
```

## Practice

Other examples of hands-on practice include:

- exercises
- quizzes
- reflection questions

These will be verifiable using the CLI. We'll also help you track your progress
throughout the course.

More details coming soon!
