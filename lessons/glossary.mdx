Vocabulary is such an underrated part of learning a new skill or technology.

In my courses, I try to include one at the end so that folks can review
technical terms discussed throughout the course and build confidence in knowing
how to talk about the technical content after the course.

## Terms

- **payload** - usually refers to information you receieve from a response when
  talking to a server or endpoint.
- **script** - a set of instructions that you write and run from the command
  line (usually) which tells the computer to do something.
